# Predicting-WTA-Match-Winners
This project leverages various analytical tools and machine learning techniques to predict the winner of a given Women's Tennis Association (WTA) match. I cleaned the data using Tableau prep and made visualizations of the data using Tableau. I utilized WTA data spanning over 5 years (2015-2020) to train my predictive model using R, and used logistic regression to predict the outcomes of a given tennis match. This model was successful in predicting the winner of a given tennis match with over 86% accuracy.

This project was inspired by my love of the game of tennis since childhood. I grew up watching the greats play, including my favorites: Serena and Venus Williams, Caroline Wozniacki, and Roger Federer. Growing up, I liked to model my personal tennis game after these greats. Now, as a data analyst, I was inspired to complete a project that incorporated my love for the sport. Enjoy diving into this project!
